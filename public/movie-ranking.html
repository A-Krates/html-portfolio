<h3>Passengers</h3>
<p>Passengers (2016) is a visually stunning sci-fi romance film with a thought-provoking premise. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt star as two passengers on a long-haul spaceship to a new planet who wake up from their cryosleep capsules 90 years early. They must find a way to save the ship and its crew, while also grappling with the ethical implications of their situation.

    The film has been praised for its production values, performances, and special effects. However, it has also been criticized for its uneven plot and its portrayal of consent. Some viewers have found it difficult to forgive Pratt's character for waking Lawrence's character up without her consent.
    
    Overall, Passengers is a thought-provoking and entertaining film with a lot to offer. It is sure to stay with you long after the credits roll.
